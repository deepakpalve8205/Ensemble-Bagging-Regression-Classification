# Ensemble-Bagging-Regression-Classification
This repository implements Bagging for classification and regression using Random Forest. Bagging reduces overfitting by training multiple models on different data subsets and aggregating their predictions. It improves accuracy and stability. Includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
